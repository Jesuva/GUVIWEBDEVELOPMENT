#SIGNIN PAGE
The signin page is designed with the overlay container,so that the user can either signin or signup in the same page

#profile
The profile page displays the data of the corresponding user stored in the database, the overlay container concept here used to both display and 
update the user details in the same page

#Database
The database cancept used here is to divide the user login details and profile details in the seperate tables,
so the query will be more optimised to execute the signing and update commands.
The relationship between the two tables is implemented using the userid which is internally generated and cand be used as reference to 
unqiuely identify the user details in the user_profile table.
